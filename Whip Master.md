# Whip
Whips are a fun and interesting weapon, but sadly they don't see much use due to their poor damage (1d4) and lack of feats to give them meaningful bonuses. The content featured here is adapted from the excellent homebrew "Whip Savant" designed for 5e.14 by u/Ashamed-Plant (Reddit)

## Whip Master (Feat)
*General Feat (Prerequisite: Level 4+)*

You have mastered the art of fighting with a whip, able to strike with power and precision. You gain Proficiency with Whips in addition to the following benefits.
:
**Ability Score Increase.** Increase your Dexterity, Strength, or Intelligence score by 1, to a maximum </br>of 20.
:
**Lash.** When you hit any target with a Whip, you can add 1d4 to the damage roll of the whip.
:
**Precise Strike.** Once per turn, when you hit a creature with a whip, instead of dealing damage you can choose an effect from the list below. The DC for saving throws to resist these effects is 8 + your Proficiency bonus + your Dexterity or Strength modifier (your choice).

- **Bind.** The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be Grappled by you. You cannot attack with a whip that is being used to grapple a creature in </br>this way.
- **Disarm.** The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw, or drop one item of your choice it is holding (not wearing). The creature has Advantage on this saving throw if the item is being held with two hands.
- **Pull.** The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw, or you pull the creature 5 feet towards you if it is the same size as you or smaller, otherwise you pull yourself 5 feet towards the target. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks
- **Sweep.** The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
