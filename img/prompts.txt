Whip Master. A semi-realistic watercolor painting captures a dramatic battle scene, where a determined warrior brandishing a whip faces off against an armored opponent in the foreground. Set against a chaotic, distant conflict, the image uses earthy tones and splashes of red to emphasize the tension between the two central figures amid blurred, impressionistic background action.
